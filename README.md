# ThouSands Forum

## What is ThouSands?
A Web App made originally focused for the Project ThouSands Game bug report and feedback forum.
now improved to be general purpose forum for sharing stuff and much like other online communities you can share your stuff, discuss about it in the forum, or even share your own works in there! i'm actually will try it!(just don't send malware, you've been warned)

## features
- Forums
- Open Library for sharing your works
- basically social platform with less general features

## Q&A
- whats the goal behind making this?
A: more of a learning foundation for me to implement a functioning web app, but also a platform in which anyone can share and discuss their own works.

you may ask
"why php? is there no other language you can use or you just being lazy?"
whatever you want to call me but neither of that is the answer, simply i've already bought php hosting month prior before hackathon because I were interested in learning PHP again before joining hackathon so i just go with it.

oh and one thing, give me back my coffee >:(
