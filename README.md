## short Q&A
you may ask
"why php? is there no other language you can use or you just being lazy?"
whatever you want to call me but neither of that is the answer, simply i've already bought php hosting month prior before hackathon because I were interested in learning PHP again before joining hackathon so i just go with it.

oh and one thing, give me back my coffee >:(
