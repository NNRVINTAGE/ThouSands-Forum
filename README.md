## What is ThouSands Forum & ThouSands Library?
This project originally focused for the Project ThouSands Game bug report and feedback forum,
after some thought I've come to a realization that if the system extended beyond the goal this can be an opportunity for me to develop software distribution system and open forum community for the other developer.<br>
It's goal now are to be an open source software distribution platform for everyone to publish their works, explore others software, give and recieve feedback with the community.
