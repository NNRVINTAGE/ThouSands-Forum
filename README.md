## Quick start
in your local machine it is recommended for you to have these in your enviroment

MySQL something
PHP 8.2.2

if you'd have installed them import the db.sql to your MySQL database
and then open up the `index.php` file on your browser to check if the site are working

## Contributing
Any help is greatly appreciated but currently the project is in need of a rework and migration after the Operational Beta release as this is more of a proof of concept for the idea itself
